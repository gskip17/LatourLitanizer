# LatourLitanizer

This is a pet project project designed to emulate Ian Bogost's Latour Litanizer from his book on Object Oriented Ontology Theory, <u>'Alien Phenomenology, or What It's Like to Be a Thing'</u>.

The Litanizer is a simple web app that pulls random entries from the Wikipedia API to create 'random' litany poems - or list poems.
